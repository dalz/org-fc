;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Adds audio playback during review.
;;
;; Audio files can be played at different times:
;; - before the card is set up
;; - after the card is set up
;;
;; This distinction is relevant for text-input cards where the card
;; setup ends only after the user has entered their answer.
;;
;; The `mpv` media player needs to be installed for this to work.
